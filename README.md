# Mental-Health-Analysis-for-Citadel-University
A comprehensive mental health analysis for Citadel University, focusing on the second semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. 

As part of my continued development in data analytics with Vephla University (Data School), I recently conducted a comprehensive mental health analysis for Citadel University, focusing on the second semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The dataset for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.com, and my objective was to extract key insights into students' mental health patterns and behaviors. The goal was to provide actionable recommendations to support and promote better mental health practices within the student community.

Key Findings:

•	Institution with the Highest Workload: PU, with an average of 207 sessions per semester.

•	Most Isolated Educational Level: First-year students, with 119 individuals reported as victims of isolation.

•	Educational Level with Highest Financial Concerns: First-year students, with 39.3% of the cohort expressing concerns about finances.

•	Educational Level with Highest Anxiety: First-year students, with 106 individuals suffering from anxiety.

2.	Reduce Social Isolation: Implement peer mentorship programs and encourage participation in clubs and social events to help first-year students integrate.
3.	Address Financial Concerns: Provide financial literacy workshops and promote access to financial aid, scholarships, and employment resources.
4.	Relieve Pressure: Offer stress management workshops, mindfulness training, and improve access to counseling services for high-pressure age groups.
5.	Combat Anxiety: Increase accessibility to mental health resources like counseling, mindfulness programs, and stress-relief events during exams.
6.	Manage Depression: Provide regular mental health check-ins, peer support networks, and train resident assistants to identify and support students with depression.
